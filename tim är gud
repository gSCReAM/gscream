ok, so the problem is not with the pipeline but with the application
you can try checking the debug log GST_DEBUG=*:LOG ./yourapp 2>&1 | grep -i error

I suspect it will be not-linked
line 119 looks not quite right, the link between decodebin + x264enc will fail at that point, because there are no pads yet
on decodebin
you will handle that via the pad-added signal
but the side effect is that the bits afterwards also don't get linked
so you need to do two gst_element_link_many(), one for source, decodebin, NULL  and one for x264enc, ...udpsink, NULL
and then the pad added callback bridges the gap between decodebin + x264enc [or better videoconvert]
also check the gst_pad_link return value (note that it's an enum not a bool)
